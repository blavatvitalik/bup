    		Counter-Strike, also known as Half-Life: Counter-Strike and Counter-Strike 1.6, is a multiplayer first-person shooter video game developed and published for Microsoft Windows by American company Valve. Counter-Strike was originally a custom modification for the Half-Life game, developed by enthusiasts Min Le and Jess Cliff in 1999; Later, Valve hired both developers and acquired the intellectual property rights to the game from them, releasing a modified version of Counter-Strike as a standalone game in 2000.
